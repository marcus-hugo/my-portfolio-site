# My new Portfolio site!

## Goals

I wanted to showcase my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, in a way that that others could read, learn, and utilize in their projects or portfolio. In keeping the code organized I followed the BEM methodolgy with Sass.
My aim was to keep the UI simple, responsive, and accessible. I am definitley a fan of a dark theme UI, so I had to implement a dark/light toggle.

## Features

- Semantic HTML
- Responsive single page website with mobile navigation.
- Sass for nesting and organizing CSS.
- Accessibility:
  - WCAG 2.1 AA compliant for color contrast.
  - CSS `prefers-color-scheme: dark light` as a fallback for users system default.
  - CSS `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` to honor the users system setting.
- Dark/light toggle with local storage.
- Google Fonts
- Bootstrap Icons
