# My new Portfolio site!

## Goals

To showcase my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, in a way that others could read, learn, and utilize in their projects or portfolio. In keeping the code organized I followed the BEM methodology with Sass.
I aimed to keep the UI simple, responsive, and accessible. I am a fan of a dark theme UI, so I had to implement a dark/light toggle!

## Features

- Semantic HTML
- Responsive single page website with mobile navigation.
- Sass for nesting and organizing CSS.
- Dark/light toggle with local storage.
- Google Fonts
- Bootstrap Icons

## Accessibility

- WCAG 2.1 AA compliant color contrast. [https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-minimum]
- CSS `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` to honor the users system setting.
- Updated skip-link pattern to follow WebAim's. [https://webaim.org/techniques/css/invisiblecontent/]
- aria-hidden for non-text purely decorative content [https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#non-text-content]
- removed hamburger navigation for meaninful sequence. Focus was moving off screen. [https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#meaningful-sequence]
