# My new Portfolio site!

## Goals

I wanted to showcase my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, in a way that that others could read, learn, and utilize in their projects or portfolio. In keeping the code organized I followed the BEM methodolgy with Sass.
My aim was to keep the UI simple, responsive, and accessible. I am definitley a fan of a dark theme UI, so I had to implement a dark/light toggle.
